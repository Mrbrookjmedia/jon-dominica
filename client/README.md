# React + Vite

for backend -> cd api 
            -> then npm start
            
for frontend -> cd client 
            -> then npm run dev


current problem: 
cart and user page-> for null values 
in user page: refresh issue
clear cart btn in cart page not working
currently both profile page and cart page wishlist items are different 

changes or comment pages for this issues: adminorder , userpage and cart page

when updating product and filling size, then it bursts --->     RESOLVED
wishlist is not present in cart page


in blog page-> category, data, postpage;

wishlist should be red even after page reloads



there are some erros like all products are not seeing in shop page due to lowercase


issue->  size and color are not storing properly


new issue comes when an non admin user tries to access admin routes then they actually goes there and not blocking
